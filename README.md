## Balance saving

Your balance saves with the "SaveNumber" in the games AppData path.

**Note:** Deleting a save will cause this to go out of sync. use **lcu-force** to sync it again.\
The saving feature will be improved over time.

# Future plans

- Add more detail in this README
- Add an ATM ship upgrade - requires a credit card
- Add a credit card item - not scrap but required to access the ATM
- Move "balance" saving into the actual save file instead of an isolated JSON file

# POSSIBLE Issues

- Some kind of way to lose / gain balance upon exiting (save scumming) - this might have been fixed by now but please be aware :)
